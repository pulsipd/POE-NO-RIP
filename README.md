OhShit ! - Escape hardcore POE using a hotkey

This tool will simply execute a command line using a hotkey (hardcoded as CTRL+BACKSPACE). 

This can also be used to call CPORTS.EXE and close all tcp/udp connections on a process (ie: Path of Exile)

Must Be Run As Admin
Change the value from D:\Tools\ohshit\cports.exe to point to the location of your cports.exe
